Platinum Star Hotel Website
==========================

This is the main landing page and supporting files for the Platinum Star Hotel website.

How to View Locally:
--------------------
1. Open the folder in VS Code or your preferred editor.
2. Use a local server (recommended: VS Code Live Server extension) to preview the site.
   - Or, open `index.html` directly in your browser (some features may require a server).

Main Files:
-----------
- index.html      : Main landing page (responsive, Bootstrap 5)
- css/style.css   : Custom styles and responsive rules
- js/app.js       : Carousel, modal, and interactive features
- img/            : Images used in the site

Features:
---------
- Responsive design for all devices (Bootstrap 5 + custom CSS)
- Hero section with image carousel
- Modal booking form
- Amenities, rooms, restaurant, testimonials, and gallery sections
- Back to top button

Editing Content:
----------------
- Change text, images, or links in `index.html`.
- Update styles in `css/style.css`.
- Adjust interactive features in `js/app.js`.

Troubleshooting:
----------------
- If images do not appear, check the image URLs and ensure files are present in the `img/` folder.
- For best results, use a local server (Live Server) to avoid browser security restrictions.
- If you see layout issues on mobile, check for recent changes in `css/style.css`.
